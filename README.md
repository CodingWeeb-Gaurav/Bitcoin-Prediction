# Bitcoin Price Prediction

This repository demonstrates the results of training an LSTM model on **3 years of Bitcoin closing price data**. The model was optimized to predict future prices with high accuracy.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Consistently Low Training and Validation Loss:**  
  The training and validation loss values stayed consistently under `0.001`, showcasing the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

- **Visualized Results:**  
  Multiple graphs are provided to illustrate the model's performance, including loss graphs and prediction results.

## About the Dataset
- The data consists of **3 years of Bitcoin closing prices**.
- The model leverages this historical data to make accurate predictions for future prices.

---

## Next Steps
- Enhance the model by incorporating additional features like trading volume and sentiment analysis (e.g., from social media or news data).
- Explore real-time price predictions with streaming data.
